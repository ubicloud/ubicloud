    # Billing logic differs based on the resource type: some are billed by duration, others
    # by amount. For 'VmCores' billing records, the core counts are stored in the amount
    # column and charges are based on duration. For example, 10 minutes of standard-4 vm
    # usage would be calculated as `10 (duration) x 2 (amount) x rate_for_standard_core`.
    # 'GitHubRunnerMinutes' records, on the other hand, store the used minutes in the
    # 'amount' column, and billing is based on that amount.
    # For records billed by amount, the duration is always set to 1.
    return 1 if billing_rate["billed_by"] == "amount"
    # begin_time and end_time refers to begin and end of the billing window. Duration of
    # BillingRecord is subjective to the billing window we are querying for. For example
    # if span of the BillingRecord is ['2023-06-15', '2023-08-20'] and billing window is
    # ['2023-06-01', '2023-07-01'], then we are only interested in duration of billing
    # record that was active in June. This is effectively calculating the intersection of
    # two time ranges.
    # One complication comes from the fact billing window might have nil end point if it
    # is still active. We check for that case with span.unbounded_end?.
