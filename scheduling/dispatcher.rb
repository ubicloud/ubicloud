  # scan_delay :: Time between when the strand was scheduled, and when the scan query
  #               picked the strand up.
  # queue_delay :: Time between when the scan query picked up the strand, and when a
  #                worker thread started working on the strand.
  # lease_delay :: Time between when a worker thread started working on the strand, and
  #                when it acquired (or failed to acquire) the strand's lease.
  #
  # Respirate internals metrics:
  #
  # queue_size :: The size of the strand queue after the worker thread picked up the strand.
  #               This is the backlog of strands waiting to be processed.
  # available_workers :: The number of idle worker threads that are waiting to work on strands.
  #                      There should only be an idle worker if the queue size is currently 0.
  #
  # For the above metrics, we compute the average, median, P75, P85, P95, P99, and maximum
  # values.
  #
  # In addition to the above metrics, there are additional metrics:
  #
  # lease_acquire_percentage :: Percentage of strands where the lease was successfully acquired.
  #                             For single respirate processes, or normally running respirate
  #                             partitioned processes (1 process per partition), this should be
  #                             100.0. For multi-process, non-partitioned respirate, this can
  #                             be significantly lower, as multiple processes try to process
  #                             the same strand concurrently, and some fail to acquire the lease.
  # old_strand_percentage :: Percentage of strands that were processed that were outside the
  #                          current partition.  Should always be 0 if respirate is not partitioned.
