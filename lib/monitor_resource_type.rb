# Class that abstracts both monitored resources and metric export resources, to avoid
# duplication for the two types. Attributes:
# wrapper_class :: Either MonitorableResource or MetricsTargetResource
# resources :: Hash of resources, keyed by id
# types :: The underlying model classes (or datasets) to handle
# submit_queue :: A sized queue for submitting jobs for processing. Pushed to by the main thread,
#                 popped by worker threads.
# finish_queue :: A queue for jobs that just finished processing. Pushed to by the
#                 worker threads, popped by the main thread.
# run_queue :: An array keeping track of future jobs to run. The main thread appends jobs
#              popped from the finish queue to this array, and slices the front of the
#              and pushes those jobs to the submit queue.
# threads :: Pool/array of worker threads, which process jobs on the submit queue.
# stuck_pulse_info :: Array with timeout seconds, log message, and log key for handling stuck
#                     pulses/metric exports.
