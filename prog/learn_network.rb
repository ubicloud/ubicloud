    # Postgres's "inet" does support this IPv6-style mixture of
    # addresses and prefixlens, the "cidr" type requires masked-out
    # bits to be zero.  NetAddr's IPv6Net type clears low bits beyond
    # the prefix.

    # Maybe we can improve support for inet in a fork later, NetAddr
    # is not a fast moving project, there is room to improve it, but
    # some would be backwards-incompatible.
