Note: Managed Ubicloud deployments are always updated to the latest secure release.
If you are running Ubicloud self-hosted, please update promptly to a supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Ubicloud and its users seriously.
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public GitHub issue.
Instead, report it via our private disclosure channels.

### How to report:

Email us at security@ubicloud.com with:

A detailed description of the vulnerability

## Steps to reproduce

Potential impact and affected components

Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)

You should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours.

We will provide status updates at least once per week until the issue is resolved.

## Security Guidelines for Users

Ubicloud is an infrastructure platform, and security depends on proper configuration and updates.
Please follow these guidelines to help keep your deployments secure:

Keep Ubicloud updated — apply security patches promptly.

Rotate secrets generated by ./demo/generate_env and provider credentials stored in .env regularly.

Enable encryption — Ubicloud encrypts data at rest and in transit by default, but verify settings.

Restrict access to the control plane to trusted IP addresses or VPN users.

Use ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) to limit permissions for users and services.

Monitor logs for suspicious SSH access or API requests.

When exposing IPv6/IPv4 networking, ensure firewall rules (nftables) are properly configured.

## What We Do to Protect Users

Encryption at rest and in transit for all supported block storage and networking.

Network isolation — each tenant’s VMs operate in isolated namespaces.

Secure virtualization — VMs run under Cloud Hypervisor in Linux namespaces.

Access control — ABAC for fine-grained permissions.

Security reviews for dependencies like net-ssh, Rodauth, and SPDK.

Coordinated disclosure — vulnerabilities are patched before public release.

The Ubicloud control plane

Cloud console

Managed Ubicloud service
